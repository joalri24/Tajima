Small Windows Forms application done for a biologist friend. 

A biology software gave my friend a folder with the results of an experiment. The experiment consisted on running a simulation 1000 times. The folder contains one subfolder for each simulation. Inside each simulation folder, there is an XML file with the relevant data. My friend needed a csv file where each row contained the relevant data for each simulation.
